{"Hed":"Why the rich get richer, according to simple math","Dek":"The wealthy few have most of the money – and according to this free market simulation, it might be inevitable, unless we do something about it","scrolly":["A few years ago I impulsively bought a watch at a pawn shop for $200.","I got home and did some research. It turns out I overpaid by about $50.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was clearly my fault.","But I figured over the course of thousands of transactions, everyone wins some and loses some.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo it would eventually even out… right?","Let's do a quick simulation.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou're in a room with 99 other people, and everyone (including you) has $1,000 of wealth.","Everyone in the room gets paired up with a random person to play a coin flip game.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou get paired with this green-haired woman.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou call heads…","… but the coin lands on tails. You lose, so you give 20% to the other player. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis simulates losing and winning a trade, which we experience multiple times a day when we buy and sell things. Except in this case, the outcome is completely random.","Each person in the room finds another partner, and they play again.","Except this time, you have less money because you lost the first game. So you don't want to bet the full $200 on a coin flip. \r\n\r\n\r\nYou're only willing to bet 20% of your wealth – so $160.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou call heads…","It's tails. You lost again.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo now you're down to $640.","By now, the wealth distribution of the 100 people in the room looks like this, from poorest to richest.","But if we keep playing, it'll even out, right?\r\n\r\n\r\nLet's play 10,000 rounds of this game.","Simulating 10,000 rounds…","Whoa, what happened? The wealth didn't even out.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou lost all your money. Meanwhile, one person ended up with nearly all of the wealth!"],"IntroSection1":"This is a simulation of something called the Yard-sale model.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's a basic model of how a free market works. In this world, everyone is allowed to openly trade goods and services – and the government won't intervene. They won't stop you from trading money for drugs, they won't collect taxes when you trade money for gasoline, and they won't force a business to pay you a minimum wage for your labor.\r\n\r\n\r\nPeople who support a completely free market say that each person will try to make the best decision for themselves – but obviously they'll win some trades and lose some trades. And if some people end up a lot richer, it just means they made better trades.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut this simulation shows that this assumption is wrong. In fact, the eventual conclusion of this simulation is that, in a free market, all of the wealth trickles up to one person – and this conclusion is reached even faster when we start with some people having a lot more money than others.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is because of a simple mathematical reality.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet's say you're always willing to wager 20% of your wealth. You start with $100, which means if you win one time, your wealth increases to $120. But if you lose 20% on your next trade, you're down to $96 – lower than your initial amount. If we play this out 10 turns, your wealth slowly decreases. In short, you actually have to win more than 50% of the time in order to gain money.","IntroSection2":"Meanwhile, the richer person doesn't have to worry about how much is at risk. So if they start with $1,000 and win every other trade, here's how their wealth would change.","IntroSection3":"From their perspective, the only limit is how much the poorer person is willing to risk, and it ends up being a win-win scenario. If they win, they gain money. If they lose, that means the next time around they have the potential to win back what they lost in the previous round – and then some.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn other words, as long as most of their trades are with poorer people, their wealth creeps upward. Without intervention in a free market, the rich get richer because of, well, math.","MiddleHed":"How should we expect wealth to be distributed?","MiddleSection1":"As far back as the late-1800s, economists noticed that there was a general trend to how wealth was distributed in an economy. Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto saw that 80% of the land in Italy was owned by 20% of the population, and he observed that this trend holds true in several other countries.","MiddleSection2":"Pareto's general idea turned out to be correct. But for modern-day American wealth, this 80/20 law was off by quite a lot.","MiddleSection3":"A few decades ago, physicists got involved. They normally study the physical world – like how two balls might interact when they hit each other. But they started using their methods to study economics – a field now dubbed econophysics. Instead of looking at how two balls interact, they looked at how two people might interact in a trade, and then modeled how that might play out on a national scale. This helped them model wealth distribution.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2002, physicist Anirban Chakraborti published a paper that laid out a very simple model –  the simulation we played in the introduction.","MiddleSection4":"To be clear, econophysics gets its fair share of criticism. But the Yard-sale model isn't meant to model the real world with exacting precision.\r\n \r\nI emailed University of California-Berkeley economist Gabriel Zucman, who advised Senator Elizabeth Warren when she proposed a wealth tax in 2021. Zucman said the Yard-sale model is a more generalized model than what economists tend to work with, but it \"seems relevant as a simple statistical model of wealth distributions.\" \r\n\r\n\r\nTufts University math professor Bruce M. Boghosian echoed that sentiment when he compared the Yard-sale model to to an \"X-ray in Scientific American-\r\n\r\n\r\nWe believe that this purely analytical approach, which resembles an x-ray in that it is used not so much to represent the messiness of the real world as to strip it away and reveal the underlying skeleton, provides deep insight into the forces acting to increase poverty and inequality today.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn other words, the Yard-sale model can't really inform specific policy decisions since it doesn't capture the incredibly complex variables in the economy. But it can be useful as a way to think about the general \"trickle-up\" characteristics of a free market. And the conclusion of most papers on the Yard-sale model is that oligarchy might be inevitable – unless we do something about it.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the very last line of his seminal 2002 paper on this model, Chakraborti wrote- \"[Wealth concentration] can be prevented, for example, by government intervention via taxes, but we do not consider any such thing in our model.\"","EndHed":"Doing something about oligarchy","EndSection1":"What if we run the game again, but every turn we take a portion of money from the rich people and give it to the poor? Let's see what happens:","EndSection2":"Oh hey, we stopped oligarchy!\r\n\r\n\r\nThis might seem too far removed from reality. But Boghosian and his colleagues ran a similar model as the one above. They were able to match the wealth distribution in the US and Europe to within 2 percent (from 1989 to 2016).\r\n\r\n\r\nThat's because the US and Europe are not pure free market systems. In fact, Americans pay a lot of taxes, and those taxes tend to be progressive – the rich are taxed more than the poor, and wealth tends to be redistributed downward after taxation. Still, that redistribution is not nearly enough to stop the wealthiest 400 Americans  from owning 40% of the country's wealth.","EndSection3":"For decades, many conservative politicians have argued that wealth trickles downward. They've said the government should implement policies that support wealthier people who create jobs – and eventually grow the economy, which puts money in the hands of the rest of us. This ideology has led to massive tax cuts for the rich, from Ronald Reagan's tax cut in 1981 to Donald Trump's 2017 tax cut. \r\n\r\n\r\nAnd we've been able to see those results immediately.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter Trump's tax cut, ProPublica reviewed tax data for billionaires and found that the tax cut saved many of these people hundreds of millions of dollars. Economists estimate that the top 400 richest people now pay an average tax rate of 23% – a lower rate than the poorest 50% of Americans."}
