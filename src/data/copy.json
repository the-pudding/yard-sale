But this model shows us that, in a free market, nearly all the money ends up in the hands of a few people – completely by chance.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo what the hell is happening? I had trouble getting my head around this, until I walked through two people playing this coin-flip game.","IntroSection2":"Do you see the mathematical oddity playing out? When a poorer player wins 50% of their games, they somehow end up with <em>less</em> money.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe best way to understand this is from the perspective of the poorer player. \r\n\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>If the poorer person loses Game 1</strong>, they play Game 2 with less money to wager. So even if they win Game 2, they don't win back what they initially lost.</li>\r\n<li><strong>If the poorer person wins Game 1</strong>, they play Game 2 with more money to wager. So if they lose Game 2, they lose more than they initially won.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\nThis ultimately means even if the poorer player wins 50% of the time, their wealth slowly decreases. So where does the money go?\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the richer player.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the richer person's perspective, every game they lose means they have an opportunity to win a larger pot the next time. Every game they win means their opponent has less money – which makes it even easier for the richer person to hold onto their wealth.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou might think: How closely could this possibly correlate with reality? A few years ago, researchers <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037843711730081X\">ran this model</a> with adjustments for how wealth is redistributed by the government. They were able to match the wealth distribution in the US and Europe to an astounding degree. (More on this later.)","MiddleHed":"How should we expect wealth to be distributed?","MiddleSection1":"As far back as the late-1800s, economists noticed that there was a general trend to how wealth was distributed in an economy. Italian economist <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Vilfredo-Pareto#ref37223\">Vilfredo Pareto</a> saw that 80% of the land in Italy was owned by 20% of the population, and he <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20130531151249/http://www.institutcoppet.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Cours-d%C3%A9conomie-politique-Tome-II-Vilfredo-Pareto.pdf\">observed</a> that this trend <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2225567\">holds true</a> in several other countries.\r\n\r\n\r\nPareto was onto something. Wealth does get concentrated at the top. In fact, in the US the wealthiest 20% of families own about <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2022-09/57598-family-wealth.pdf\">70% of wealth</a>.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut what Pareto may not have predicted is what's happening at the very top and the very bottom. According to the latest <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/dataviz/dfa/distribute/table/\">Federal Reserve data</a>, the wealthiest 0.1% of Americans are four times richer than the bottom 50%.\r\n\r\n\r\nA few decades ago, physicists got involved in studying inequality. They normally study the physical world – like how two balls might interact when they hit each other. But they started using their methods to study economics – a field now dubbed econophysics. Instead of looking at how two balls interact, they looked at how two people might interact in a trade, and then modeled how that might play out on a large scale. This helped them model wealth distribution.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2002, physicist Anirban Chakraborti published <a href=\"https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/10.1142/S0129183102003905\">a paper</a> that laid out a very simple model –  the simulation we played in the introduction.","MiddleSection2":"To be clear, econophysics gets its <a href=\"http://keenomics.s3.amazonaws.com/debtdeflation_media/papers/GallegattiKeenLuxOrmerod2006WorryingTrendsInEconophysics_PhysicaA370pp1-6.pdf\">fair share</a> of criticism. But the Yard-sale model isn't meant to model the real world with exacting precision.\r\n \r\nI emailed University of California-Berkeley economist Gabriel Zucman, who <a href=\"https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Wealth%20Tax%20Revenue%20Estimates%20by%20Saez%20and%20Zucman%20-%20Feb%2024%2020211.pdf\">advised</a> Senator Elizabeth Warren when she <a href=\"https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/warren-jayapal-boyle-introduce-ultra-millionaire-tax-on-fortunes-over-50-million\">proposed</a> a wealth tax in 2021. Zucman said the Yard-sale model is a more generalized model than what economists tend to work with, but it's still useful.","Quote1":"It \"seems relevant as a simple statistical model of wealth distributions.\"","MiddleSection3":"Tufts University math professor Bruce M. Boghosian echoed that sentiment when he compared the Yard-sale model to an \"X-ray\" in <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-inequality-inevitable/\">Scientific American</a>.","Quote2":"\"We believe that this purely analytical approach, which resembles an x-ray in that it is used not so much to represent the messiness of the real world as to strip it away and reveal the underlying skeleton, provides deep insight into the forces acting to increase poverty and inequality today.\"","MiddleSection4":"In other words, the Yard-sale model can't really inform specific policy decisions since it doesn't capture the incredibly complex variables in the economy. But it can be useful as a way to think about the general \"trickle-up\" characteristics of a free market. And the conclusion of most papers on the Yard-sale model is that oligarchy might be inevitable – unless we do something about it.","EndHed":"What if we redistribute wealth?","EndSection1":"In his seminal 2002 paper on this model, Chakraborti wrote, \"[Wealth concentration] can be prevented, for example, by government intervention via taxes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSo what if we run the game again, but every turn we take a percentage of money from everyone and redistribute it evenly? We'll also add in a feature that lets people wager more or less of their money.","EndSection2":"You can see that even a moderately small amount of redistribution stops a single uber wealthy person from emerging.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is similar to what Boghosian and his colleagues did in a <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037843711730081X\">2017 paper</a>, where they were able to match the wealth distribution in the US and Europe to within 2 percent.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat's because the US and Europe are not pure free market systems. In fact, Americans <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/11/4/20938229/zucman-saez-tax-rates-top-400\">pay a lot of taxes</a>, and those taxes tend to be progressive – the rich are taxed more than the poor. And for the most part, that money is used for government programs that usually help the poor more than the rich. Still, that redistribution is not nearly enough to stop the <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kerryadolan/2021/10/05/the-2021-forbes-400-list-of-richest-americans-facts-and-figures/?sh=53d00da934e9\">wealthiest 400 Americans</a> from owning 40% of the country's wealth.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor decades, many conservative politicians have argued that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trickle-down_economics\">wealth trickles downward</a>. They've said the government should implement policies that support wealthier people who create jobs – and eventually grow the economy, which puts money in the hands of the rest of us. This ideology has led to massive tax cuts for the rich, from <a href=\"https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/reagan-signs-economic-recovery-tax-act-erta\">Ronald Reagan's tax cut in 1981</a> to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/d782be5ecd4646c1a76516aa50070662\">Donald Trump's 2017 tax cut</a>. \r\n\r\n\r\nAnd we've been able to see those results immediately.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter Trump's tax cut, <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/secret-irs-files-reveal-how-much-the-ultrawealthy-gained-by-shaping-trumps-big-beautiful-tax-cut\">ProPublica</a> reviewed tax data for billionaires and found that the tax cut saved many of these people hundreds of millions of dollars. Economists estimate that the top 400 richest people now pay an average tax rate of 23% – a lower rate than the poorest 50% of Americans.","EndSection3":"END SECTION Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
